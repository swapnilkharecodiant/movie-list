# Movie Management

#### Assignment - React / NextJS Full Stack Developer

#### Develop a web app. The app itself consists of a login screen and screens for displaying, creating and editing movies.

The movie entity consists of three fields:
1.	title (text)
2.	publishing year (number)
3.	poster (image)

#### You will be responsible for building the front end and the backend API

#### You can see all of the screens in the design available at:

#### Note that the design file consists of several pages:
1.	Styleguide - all colors, typography and spacings are defined there
2.	Components - components used within the app
3.	Web - The design for the web app
4.	Mobile - design for the Flutter developer assignment, but you can use it for the responsive design (not required, but does add extra points)

#### The assignment code must be submitted as a public GitHub repository and deployed in a cloud environment (AWS, Azure, or GCP)

#### We will get extra points for:
1.	Hosting the app on platforms such as GitHub pages, Heroku etc.
2.	Mobile responsiveness
3.	Form validation - showing when email/password format isnâ€™t correct or when API returns an error
4.	Movie list pagination
5.	State management
6.	Localization
7.	API documentation 
8.	Creativity - add anything you want to the app.
